#Double-SHA-256-hashing
Simple Python program to visualize how mining works in cryptocurrencies.

By tweaking the message, difficulty, and max nonce in `mining_sim.py`, you can watch the double SHA-256 hashing loop hunt for a leading-zero hash, mirroring how proof-of-work miners iterate through nonces and report how long it takes.
